# Farewell

Farewell to my wordpress blog, I am not sure whether I will switch back to wordpress in the future. It seems that NoSql is increasingly prevalent even for a tiny blog :(

Currently, Jekyll and Bootstrap template works pretty well, and the most important thing is that I can use version control system to manage my blog on github, and github can host my blog using my own domain name as well. Thanks to github :(

## Wordpress Plugin

Some plugins that I had ever used before. **syntaxhighlighter** is pretty good because I tried a lot of highlighter but most of them were not perfect together with markdown plugin.

* table-of-contents-plus

* disqus-comment-system

* jetpack-markdown

* syntaxhighlighter

* google-syntax-highlighter

* send-to-kindle
